# La Fortuna Restaurant

This is the website for La Fortuna Restaurant, Food Truck and Catering service provider located in Edinburgh. It is intended to showcase all the services of the business and its different areas. In order to achieve this, each part of the business (restaurant, food truck and catering services) have its own page on the website.

## UX

This website is made for customers to be able to find all the information they may need on a simple, quick and intuitive way, without many clicks or very long scrolling.

All pages follow the same structure, facilitating the navigation through all the pages and helping the user to fastly familiarise with how the website works, only changing the main content of each page to reflect the information related to that particular page. 
All of them share the following:
- A header, which includes the logo, the brand name, a line listing the different areas of the business and a button to change the language of the site to either English or Spanish.
- A central section consisting of two parts. A sidepanel on the left hand side with a navigation menu, a button to make reservations and some additional info. The other part of this section contains the main content of each page. This last part is what is different on each page.
- A footer including contact details (email and phone number) and links to social media sites.
